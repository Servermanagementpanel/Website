  VARIABLE-GTC-Item1-1: "<b>1.1</b>&nbsp;These General Terms and Conditions (GTC) apply to all contracts for the purchase of goods, services or other goods (hereinafter referred to as &quot;goods&quot;) in the online store at the above URL in the version valid at the time the contract is concluded. These GTC apply exclusively. Deviating general terms and conditions of the customer shall not become part of the contract unless the provider expressly agrees to them."
  VARIABLE-GTC-Item2-1: "<b>2.1</b>&nbsp;The offers in the online store represent a non-binding invitation by the provider to online store visitors to submit an offer to purchase the goods offered in the store."
  VARIABLE-GTC-Item2-2: "<b>2.2</b>&nbsp;The goods are ordered via the provider's online order form. After selecting the desired product(s), entering all mandatory information requested and completing all other mandatory steps in the ordering process, the selected goods can be ordered by clicking the order button at the bottom of the checkout page (order). By placing an order, the customer submits a binding contractual offer to purchase the selected product(s). The contract is concluded when the provider accepts the customer's offer. Acceptance takes place when the provider confirms the conclusion of the contract in writing or text form (e.g. by e-mail) (order confirmation) and this order confirmation is received by the customer or by delivering the ordered goods and these goods are received by the customer or by requesting payment from the customer (e.g. invoice or credit card payment in the order process) and the payment request is received by the customer; the time at which one of the alternatives mentioned in the first half-sentence occurs for the first time is decisive for the time of conclusion of the contract."
  VARIABLE-GTC-Item2-3: "<b>2.3</b>&nbsp;Before binding submission of the order via the provider's online order form, the customer can check his entries and correct them at any time using the usual keyboard, mouse, touch or other input functions available. In addition, all entries are displayed again in a confirmation window before the binding submission of the order and can also be corrected there using the usual keyboard, mouse, touch or other input functions available."
  VARIABLE-GTC-Item2-4: "<b>2.4</b>&nbsp;The provider will save the text of the contract after the contract has been concluded and send it to the customer in text form (e.g. by email). The provider will not make the contract text accessible beyond this. If the purchase has been made via a customer account in the online store, the customer can view his orders and the associated order data there."
  VARIABLE-GTC-Item2-5: "<b>2.5</b>&nbsp;The following languages are available for the conclusion of the contract: German, English"
  VARIABLE-GTC-Item3-1: "<b>3.1</b>&nbsp;Consumers are generally entitled to a right of withdrawal for contracts concluded outside of business premises and for distance contracts. A consumer is any natural person who enters into a legal transaction for purposes that are predominantly outside their trade, business or profession. Details can be found in the cancellation policy, which is made available to every consumer at the latest immediately before the contract is concluded."
  VARIABLE-GTC-Item4-1: "<b>4.1</b>&nbsp;The prices listed in the online store at the time of ordering apply. All prices are inclusive of VAT and plus any shipping costs listed. The customer is informed about the available payment options in the provider's online store."
  VARIABLE-GTC-Item4-2: "<b>4.2</b>&nbsp;If “advance payment” has been agreed, the purchase price is due immediately after conclusion of the contract."
  VARIABLE-GTC-Item4-3: "<b>4.3</b>&nbsp;If “purchase on invoice/purchase on account” has been agreed, payment is due immediately after conclusion of the contract, unless a different payment term has been specified in the invoice or in the purchase process."
  VARIABLE-GTC-Item4-4: "<b>4.4</b>&nbsp;If “SEPA direct debit” has been agreed, payment is due immediately after conclusion of the contract. Before the purchase price is debited, the customer shall be informed of when to expect the agreed purchase price to be debited (pre-notification). The direct debit shall not be debited before receipt of this pre-notification and not before the deadline specified in the pre-notification. If the direct debit fails due to insufficient funds in the account, the provision of incorrect bank details or for other reasons for which the customer is responsible, the customer shall bear any chargeback fees incurred if the customer is responsible for the failure of the direct debit."
  VARIABLE-GTC-Item4-5: "<b>4.5</b>&nbsp;If payment by credit or debit card has been agreed, the purchase price is due immediately after conclusion of the contract."
  VARIABLE-GTC-Item4-6: "<b>4.6</b>&nbsp;If payment via “PayPal” has been agreed, the purchase price is due immediately after conclusion of the contract. Payment is processed via the payment service provider PayPal (Europe) S.à r.l. et Cie, S.C.A., 22-24 Boulevard Royal, L-2449 Luxembourg."
  VARIABLE-GTC-Item4-7: "<b>4.7</b>&nbsp;If “Sofortüberweisung” has been agreed, the purchase price is due immediately after conclusion of the contract. Payment is processed by Sofort GmbH, Theresienhöhe 12, 80339 Munich."
  VARIABLE-GTC-Item4-8: "<b>4.8</b>&nbsp;If Giropay has been agreed, the purchase price is due immediately after conclusion of the contract. Payment is processed by paydirect GmbH, Stephanstr. 14-16, 60313 Frankfurt am Main."
  VARIABLE-GTC-Item4-9: "<b>4.9</b>&nbsp;If payment via cryptocurrency has been agreed, the purchase price is due immediately after conclusion of the contract. When selecting cryptocurrencies as a payment method on our website, personal data will be transmitted to Coinbase. Coinbase is a payment service provider operated by the American company Coinbase Inc. However, Coinbase Europe Limited, based in Dublin, Ireland (70 Sir John Rogerson's Quay, Dublin D02 R296, Ireland), is responsible for the European market."
  VARIABLE-GTC-Item5-1: "<b>5.1</b>&nbsp;The purchased goods remain the property of the supplier until the purchase price has been paid in full."
  VARIABLE-GTC-Item6-1: "<b>6.1</b>&nbsp;Unless otherwise agreed, delivery shall be made within the delivery time specified in the online store to the delivery address specified by the customer. The applicable delivery times can be found in the online store."
  VARIABLE-GTC-Item6-2: "<b>6.2</b>&nbsp;Self-collection of the purchased goods is excluded."
  VARIABLE-GTC-Item6-3: "<b>6.3</b>&nbsp;If the supplier is unable to deliver the ordered goods because it has not been supplied itself through no fault of its own, even though it has concluded a congruent covering transaction with a reliable supplier in good time, the supplier shall be released from its obligation to perform and may withdraw from the contract. The supplier is obliged to inform the customer immediately of the impossibility of performance. Any payments already made by the contractual partner shall be reimbursed immediately. Mandatory consumer law remains unaffected by this paragraph."
  VARIABLE-GTC-Item7-1: "<b>7.1</b>&nbsp;The provisions of statutory liability for defects shall apply."
  VARIABLE-GTC-Item8-1: "<b>8.1</b>&nbsp;The provider is liable without limitation:"
  VARIABLE-GTC-Item8-2: "for damages resulting from injury to life, body or health, which are based on an intentional or negligent breach of duty by the provider or an intentional or negligent breach of duty by a legal representative or vicarious agent of the provider;"
  VARIABLE-GTC-Item8-3: "for damages that are based on an intentional or grossly negligent breach of duty by the provider or on an intentional or grossly negligent breach of duty by a legal representative or vicarious agent of the provider;"
  VARIABLE-GTC-Item8-4: "on the basis of a guarantee promise, insofar as no other provision has been made in this respect;"
  VARIABLE-GTC-Item8-5: "due to mandatory liability (e.g. under the Product Liability Act)"
  VARIABLE-GTC-Item8-6: "<b>8.2</b>&nbsp;If the Provider negligently breaches a material contractual obligation, its liability shall be limited to the foreseeable damage typical of the contract, unless unlimited liability applies in accordance with the preceding paragraph. Essential contractual obligations are obligations which the contract imposes on the provider according to its content in order to achieve the purpose of the contract, the fulfillment of which makes the proper execution of the contract possible in the first place and on the observance of which the customer may regularly rely."
  VARIABLE-GTC-Item8-7: "<b>8.3</b>&nbsp;Furthermore, liability of the provider and the liability of its agents and legal representatives is excluded."
  VARIABLE-GTC-Item8-8: "<b>8.4</b>&nbsp;Nerdscave is only liable for its own content on the website of our online shop and our control panel and knowledge database. Insofar as we provide access to other websites via links, we accept no responsibility for the third-party content there. We do not adopt this third-party content as our own. As soon as we become aware of illegal content on external websites, we will immediately block access to these pages.  <br> Our liability under the Telecommunications Act remains unaffected by this."
  VARIABLE-GTC-Item8-9: "<b>8.5</b>&nbsp;Temporary restrictions on the availability of services totalling up to 0.09% per month are taken into account in the price and cost structure and do not entitle the customer to refunds or other claims."
  VARIABLE-GTC-Item8-A: "<b>8.6</b>&nbsp;If availability falls below the level guaranteed by Nerdscave, the customer receives a one-off credit for the affected service, based on the projected downtime over one year. Electricity costs are excluded from these credits. If the contract term is less than one year, this contract term is used as the basis:"
  VARIABLE-GTC-Item8-B: "If the minimum availability falls below 0.1 % to 0.5 %, 50 % of the monthly basic price will be reimbursed."
  VARIABLE-GTC-Item8-C: "If the minimum availability falls below 0.6 % to 1.5 %, 75 % of the monthly basic price will be reimbursed."
  VARIABLE-GTC-Item8-D: "If the minimum availability is fallen short of by more than 1.5 %, 100 % of the monthly basic price will be reimbursed."
  VARIABLE-GTC-Item8-E: "Further claims for damages by the customer are excluded."
  VARIABLE-GTC-Item9-1: "<b>9.1</b>&nbsp;The various top-level domains (‘endings’) are administered by a large number of different, mostly national organisations. Each of these domain registries has its own terms and conditions for the registration and administration of top-level domains, the corresponding sub-level domains and regulations for domain disputes. If top-level domains are the subject of the contract, the respective allocation conditions apply in addition to these GTC. For .de domains, the DENIC Domain Terms and Conditions, the DENIC Domain Guidelines and the DENICdirect Price List also apply. <br> Please ask us directly about the regulations and conditions that apply to your domain."
  VARIABLE-GTC-ItemA-1: "<b>10.1</b>&nbsp;Nerdscave guarantees an average server availability of 99.8% per year, unless otherwise agreed. This excludes periods in which the server is unavailable due to technical or other problems beyond our control (force majeure, fault of third parties, etc.). We reserve the right to restrict access to our services if this is necessary for the security of network operation, to maintain network integrity or to avoid serious disruption to the network, software or stored data."
  VARIABLE-GTC-ItemA-2: "<b>10.2</b>&nbsp;The customer has no entitlement to the server remaining assigned the same IP address for the entire term of the contract."
  VARIABLE-GTC-ItemA-3: "<b>10.3</b>&nbsp;Each customer's domain can only be assigned to one of our service tariffs."
  VARIABLE-GTC-ItemA-4: "<b>10.4</b>&nbsp;When ordering, the customer selects a specific tariff."
  VARIABLE-GTC-ItemB-1: "<b>11.1</b>&nbsp;When procuring and/or managing domains, we merely act as an intermediary in the relationship between the customer and the respective domain registry. Nerdscave has no influence on the allocation of domains. We do not guarantee that the domains applied for by the customer will be allocated at all and/or that allocated domains are free of third-party rights or will be valid in the long term."
  VARIABLE-GTC-ItemB-2: "<b>11.2</b>&nbsp;The customer assures that the domain applied for does not infringe any third-party rights. Furthermore, the customer shall indemnify Nerdscave against any liability for infringements should claims be made against Nerdscave due to an infringement of third-party rights."
  VARIABLE-GTC-ItemB-3: "<b>11.3</b>&nbsp;The customer is obliged to notify us immediately of any loss of his domain. If the customer intends to reacquire his domain from a third party, he is obliged to inform us immediately of the commencement of negotiations with this third party. In addition, the customer is obliged to respond to enquiries from us regarding the status of negotiations with the third party and to grant us the priority right to reacquire the domain for the customer, provided that this does not unreasonably prejudice the interests of the customer."
  VARIABLE-GTC-ItemC-1: "<b>12.1</b>&nbsp;The customer is obliged to label the content published on its website as its own content, stating its full name and address. The customer is advised that additional statutory labelling obligations may exist, in particular if teleservices or media services are offered on the Internet pages. The customer shall indemnify Nerdscave against all claims based on a breach of the aforementioned obligations."
  VARIABLE-GTC-ItemC-2: "<b>12.2</b>&nbsp;The customer may not commit any offences against legal prohibitions, common decency or the rights of third parties (including trademark, name, copyright and data protection rights) through its Internet presence and the banners displayed there. In particular, the customer is prohibited from offering or displaying pornographic content or services which are aimed at making a profit and which involve pornographic or erotic content (such as nude images or peep shows). The customer may not enter his Internet presence in search engines if this violates legal prohibitions, common decency or the rights of third parties through the use of keywords. In the event of a breach of one of these obligations, Nerdscave reserves the right to block the customer's access and, if necessary, to terminate the existing contract for cause following a thorough examination."
  VARIABLE-GTC-ItemC-3: "<b>12.3</b>&nbsp;Nerdscave is not obliged to check the customer's Internet presence for possible legal violations. However, if legal violations or unauthorised content are identified, Nerdscave reserves the right to block the services.
