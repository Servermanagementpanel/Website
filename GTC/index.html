These GTC apply exclusively. Deviating general terms and conditions of the customer shall not become part of the contract unless the provider expressly agrees to them.</p>

                                <p><b>2.1</b>&nbsp;The offers in the online store represent a non-binding invitation by the provider to online store visitors to submit an offer to purchase the goods offered in the store.</p>
                                <p><b>2.2</b>&nbsp;The goods are ordered via the provider's online order form. After selecting the desired product(s), entering all mandatory information requested and completing all other mandatory steps in the ordering process, the selected goods can be ordered by clicking the order button at the bottom of the checkout page (order). By placing an order, the customer submits a binding contractual offer to purchase the selected product(s). The contract is concluded when the provider accepts the customer's offer. Acceptance takes place when the provider confirms the conclusion of the contract in writing or text form (e.g. by e-mail) (order confirmation) and this order confirmation is received by the customer or by delivering the ordered goods and these goods are received by the customer or by requesting payment from the customer (e.g. invoice or credit card payment in the order process) and the payment request is received by the customer; the time at which one of the alternatives mentioned in the first half-sentence occurs for the first time is decisive for the time of conclusion of the contract.</p>
                                <p><b>2.3</b>&nbsp;Before binding submission of the order via the provider's online order form, the customer can check his entries and correct them at any time using the usual keyboard, mouse, touch or other input functions available. In addition, all entries are displayed again in a confirmation window before the binding submission of the order and can also be corrected there using the usual keyboard, mouse, touch or other input functions available.</p>
                                <p><b>2.4</b>&nbsp;The provider will save the text of the contract after the contract has been concluded and send it to the customer in text form (e.g. by email). The provider will not make the contract text accessible beyond this. If the purchase has been made via a customer account in the online store, the customer can view his orders and the associated order data there.</p>
                                <p><b>2.5</b>&nbsp;The following languages are available for the conclusion of the contract: German, English</p>

                                <p><b>3.1</b>&nbsp;Consumers are generally entitled to a right of withdrawal for contracts concluded outside of business premises and for distance contracts. A consumer is any natural person who enters into a legal transaction for purposes that are predominantly outside their trade, business or profession. Details can be found in the cancellation policy, which is made available to every consumer at the latest immediately before the contract is concluded.</p>

                                <p><b>4.2</b>&nbsp;If “advance payment” has been agreed, the purchase price is due immediately after conclusion of the contract.</p>
                                <p><b>4.3</b>&nbsp;If “purchase on invoice/purchase on account” has been agreed, payment is due immediately after conclusion of the contract, unless a different payment term has been specified in the invoice or in the purchase process.</p>
                                <p><b>4.4</b>&nbsp;If “SEPA direct debit” has been agreed, payment is due immediately after conclusion of the contract. Before the purchase price is debited, the customer shall be informed of when to expect the agreed purchase price to be debited (pre-notification). The direct debit shall not be debited before receipt of this pre-notification and not before the deadline specified in the pre-notification.

                                <p>A server with administration rights requires comprehensive knowledge of server administration. As the server administrator, the customer bears sole responsibility for the security of the server against unwanted access and manipulation by third parties via the Internet. We have no regular means of monitoring the content of the server, in particular no administrative access. Unless otherwise agreed, the server offers do not include backup protection or protection by external protection software. We strongly recommend that the customer creates his own backups and installs and regularly updates reliable protection software such as a firewall or virus protection programs. Unsecured or inadequately secured “open” servers are an invitation for hackers to misuse them! If we discover that the server is being misused by third parties to a significant extent (e.g. as part of a hacker attack), we reserve the right to disconnect the server from the network without prior notice. We will inform the customer of this measure immediately.</p>
                                <p>If the customer operates open mail relays or similar systems through which, for example, SPAM mails can be distributed, we reserve the right to disconnect the server from the network immediately. The customer is required to inform Nerdscave immediately as soon as he suspects that third parties are using his server without authorization.</p>
                                <p>Responsibility for updating the operating and application software installed on the server lies exclusively with the customer. It is the customer's duty to inform themselves independently about available updates and new versions and to install these independently and at their own expense and risk.</p>
                                <p>The customer is prohibited from offering or distributing copyrighted content without authorization. The provision of P2P file-sharing platforms, download services or streaming services through which copyright-protected content may be distributed without authorization is not permitted. The provision of links to such platforms or content is also prohibited. In the event of violations, we reserve the right to take the server offline without prior notice and to terminate the contract without notice. Furthermore, the operation of cryptocurrency mining programs and the scanning of third-party systems or IP addresses is not permitted. The following also applies here: In the event of a violation, we reserve the right to disconnect the server from the network without prior notice and to terminate the contract without notice. In addition, the customer is obliged to configure his programs so that they restart automatically when the hardware or operating system is restarted.</p>
                                <p>The use of programs for cryptocurrency mining (cryptonodes) and the scanning of third-party systems or IP addresses are also prohibited.</p>
